# Introduction

Hi, I'm [Evan Pratten](https://github.com/Ewpratten), and I felt like writing another "book" about programming. Last time I did this, I was still very new to just about everything I cover in this one, and got a lot of things wrong.

The main goal of my second book is to build a "from the ground up" guide on programming that I can point my friends at instead of my usual *getting horribly sidetracked* when explaining low-level concepts.

If you find this material useful, please reach out to me and let me know!

I cannot guarantee that everything in this book will be 100% accurate, but I intend to keep it as close to the truth as possible. If you would like to make a revision or suggestion, open an [Issue](https://github.com/Ewpratten/sdfs/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/Ewpratten/sdfs/pulls).

Almost every programming tutorial I have ever seen jumps straight in to the high-level code, and leaves out any detail on whats actually going on when you run your programs. The goal of this book is to instead teach you the very basics of how a computer works, then build on top of that. Don't let that scare you though, I try to keep all the "boring" details as interesting as possible, and provide many examples and links to help you understand what you are reading.

**NOTICE: This book is still under development, and is not yet complete.**
