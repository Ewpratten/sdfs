# More Math: Averaging Two numbers

Using our new-found ability to store things in registers, and perform operations on them, let's write a program that finds the average between the following sets of numbers:

- `1` and `7`
- `2` and `10`
- `5` and `31`

As you should already know, to find the average between numbers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we compute:

\\[
\frac{A + B}{2}
\\]

Since we are going to perform the same action multiple times, I'll write the logic once in a snippet below, then we can re-use it in the main program. The snippet below will take \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as the values in registers `RAX` and `RDX`, respectively, then store the result in `RAX`.

```x86asm
addl %rdx, %rax
movl %rax, %rdx
shrl $32, %rdx
addl %rdx, %rax
sarl %rax
```

Why this doesn't use a `div` instruction when dividing? I'm not quite sure. My understanding is that byte manipulation with `shrl` and `sarl` is simply faster to execute than `div`.

Anyways, back to the main goal. We now have a snipped of assembly code that can average the contents of `RAX` and `RDX`. To compute the averages of the numbers above, we just need to run it a few times for each set of numbers. Here is the full code:

```x86asm
main:
    mov 1, %rax
    mov 7, %rdx

    add %rdx, %rax
    mov %rax, %rdx
    shr $32, %rdx
    add %rdx, %rax
    sar %rax

    mov 2, %rax
    mov 10, %rdx

    add %rdx, %rax
    mov %rax, %rdx
    shr $32, %rdx
    add %rdx, %rax
    sar %rax

    mov 5, %rax
    mov 31, %rdx

    add %rdx, %rax
    mov %rax, %rdx
    shr $32, %rdx
    add %rdx, %rax
    sar %rax
```
