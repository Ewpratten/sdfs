# Using a Register: Creating an Adder

Real quickly, to show how you might use a register in your code, we'll create our second program.

This program will store the number `1` in the register `RAX`, then add `3` to it, and store that result in `RAX` again.

```asm
main:
    mov 1, %rax
    add 3, %rax
```

This is the last time I'll show the generated machine code for some assembly. This program will produce the following machine code when compiled:

```
48 8b 04 25 01 00 00 00 48 03 04 25 03 00 00 00
```

As you can see, this is starting to get very unreasonable to understand. Good thing we switched to assembly, isn't it? ðŸ˜‰
