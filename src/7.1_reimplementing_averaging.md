# Re-Implementing the Averaging Function

Remember our 35-ish line program to find the averages of a few sets of numbers? Let's re-write that in C.

First, let's start by re-implementing the `average` function itself. Remember from the last page, we no longer have to worry about calling convention since the C compiler does it for us. This greatly reduces the function size. On top of that, we now are letting the compiler decide which registers and memory locations to store our values in, so we don't need all those `mov` instructions either.

```c
int average(int a, int b) {
    return (a + b) / 2;
}
```

This ends up looking a lot different than the assembly representation we had before. The brackets beside the function name are now where we specify what we want the function to take as parameters, and we can just type out the mathematical expression as part of the return statement.

Our `main` function changes less:

```c
int main() {
    average(1, 7);
    average(2, 10);
    average(5, 31);
    return 0;
}
```

That return statement at the very end of `main` is used by some programs to indicate weather they ran successfully or failed. We won't use that.

## Inspecting the Generated Assembly

We can instruct the C compiler to spit out assembly code instead of an executable binary. This is useful for debugging very low-level code, or in this case, showing you how the C compiler generated roughly similar assembly code to the code I wrote earlier.

Although the generated code is notably not the *same* as mine. This is because compilers are generally smarter than us humans, and can optimize our code better than we can.
