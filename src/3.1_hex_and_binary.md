# Sidenote: Hexidecimal's Relation to Binary

I'm sure you've heard of [*binary*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) before, it is the lowest-level numbering system used in computing, useful for showing the electrical state of things (for example, each physical bit that makes up the byte in a memory location).

Let's take the decimal number `237`, and represent it as 8 bits in binary:

```
11101101
```

There is no way any of us are going to remember this sequence of `1` and `0`. What we can do however is split it in half:

```
1110 1101
```

With these halves (called [nibbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble)), we then can convert each nibble to a single hexidecimal digit:

```
E D
```

Joining them gives us the hexidecimal number `0xED`. While this feels more like a waste of time than anything, it is occasionaly useful for converting numbers the other way. You can encounter the number `0xF0`, and know easily that the first nibble will be all `1`s, and the second nibble will be all `0`s.
