# Standard Libraries

In pretty much any other language except assembly, instead of calling [*System Calls*](/8.1_sys_calls.html) manually, we instead call in to something called the *Standard Library*.

The Standard Library for a programming language is generally a large collection of pre-written functions provided by the language's authors. These functions are automatically available to us as program authors for our convenience.

One benefit of using a Standard Library over manual System Calls is, our code can work on multiple systems, since the Standard Library automatically handles the differences between the different systems in the background.
