# Brief Introduction to Functions

In order to understand how a function works, you will need to read the next section, but in order for the next section to make sense, you need to know what a function is.

Functions are essentially snippets of code that can be called from any part of a program. They are an easy way to avoid repetition in your code.

When you call a function in your code, the CPU will jump to the start of that function's machine code, and start executing it. Then, at the end of the function, the CPU will jump back to the point where the function was called from.

Values passed to the function are called *parameters*, and the value (there can only be one) that the function returns is called the *return value*.
