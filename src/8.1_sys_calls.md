# Introduction to System Calls

There are some things way out of scope for this book (at least for now). Printing text to the screen from assembly code is one of those things.

Luckily, the world has a never-ending supply of smart people who build things to make programming easier.

Programs running on a Linux system have access to the [Linux System Call Interface](http://faculty.nps.edu/cseagle/assembly/sys_call.html). Every syscall has a *System Call Number* associated with it that we can use to specify which syscall we want to use.

Jumping back to assembly for a moment, to make a syscall, we must:

 1. Store the syscall number in register `RAX`
 2. Do any extra work specified for that specific syscall 
    - This could include telling the syscall how much data we have, and passing some extra arguments
 3. Call the Kernel by using the `int 0x80` instruction

For a quick example. Let's say we want a program that just calls the `exit` syscall, we could write:

```x86asm
main:
    mov $1, %rax
    int 0x80
```
