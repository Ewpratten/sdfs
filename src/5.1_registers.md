# Registers: A Special Type of Memory

Back in the [*Computer Memory*](/3_memory.html) page, I said I wasn't going to explain how memory is broken up. This page is the first of a few where I'll explain it anyways.

`x86_64` cpus have a very small handful of very special memory locations called registers. These are physically *inside* the CPU, making them extremely fast to interact with. Due to this, they are being used all the time, and pretty important to understand.

Each architecture handles this a little different, but `x86_64`'s registers can hold `64` bits of data *per register* (That's where the `_64` comes from, regular `x86` only holds `32` bits).

In assembly code, we can directly access these registers using their special names.

| Register      | Description       |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| `RAX`         | General purpose   |
| `RBX`         | General purpose   |
| `RCX`         | General purpose   |
| `RDX`         | General purpose   |
| `RSP`         | [Stack]() pointer |
| `RBP`         | Base pointer      |
| `RSI`         | General purpose   |
| `RDI`         | General purpose   |
| `R8` to `R15` | General purpose   |

As I mentioned earlier, these registers are `64` bits long, *way* bigger than we need most of the time. To make things easier for smaller values, Intel assembly lets us specify that we only want to access *part* of a register, meaning we could store up to three *separate* values in the same register, while treating it as three separate virtual registers.

We can use the following tables to determine which mnemonic to use for each virtual register:

| Base Register | 32-bit segment  | 16-bit segment  | 8-bit segment   |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `RAX`         | `EAX`           | `AX`            | `AL`            |
| `RBX`         | `EBX`           | `BX`            | `BL`            |
| `RCX`         | `ECX`           | `CX`            | `CL`            |
| `RDX`         | `EDX`           | `DX`            | `DL`            |
| `RSP`         | `ESP`           | `SP`            | `SPL`           |
| `RBP`         | `EBP`           | `BP`            | `BPL`           |
| `RSI`         | `ESI`           | `SI`            | `SIL`           |
| `RDI`         | `EDI`           | `DI`            | `DIL`           |
| `R8` to `R15` | `R8D` to `R15D` | `R8W` to `R15W` | `R8B` to `R15B` |
