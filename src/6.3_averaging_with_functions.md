# Averaging Two Numbers: Now with Functions!

Alright. Let's revisit the [*Averaging Two numbers*](/5.3_averaging.html) example from before. This time, instead of copy/paste-ing the average snipped, we can make it a function.

Following the [*Calling Convention*](), we can move our `average` snippet into its own function:

```x86asm
average:
    push %rbp 
    mov %rsp, %rbp 
    sub  $4, %rsp 
    push %rdi 
    push %rsi

    pop %rdx
    pop %rax

    add %rdx, %rax
    mov %rax, %rdx
    shr $32, %rdx
    add %rdx, %rax
    sar %rax

    pop %rsi
    pop %rdi
    mov %rbp, %rsp
    pop %rbp
    ret
```

You'll notice it got bigger, but the same core code is still there. That's because we now have to follow the "Callee's Rules" set out by the calling convention. No end functionality has changed.

The `main` section now looks a lot smaller, as it only has to push arguments to the stack and call the `average` function:

```x86asm
main:
    push $7
    push $1
    call average

    push $10
    push $2
    call average

    push $31
    push $5
    call average
```


The result will still be stored in the `RAX` register after every function call (yes I planned that out on purpose earlier).
