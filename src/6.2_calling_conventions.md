# Calling Conventions

Now that you know what a function is, you may be able to immediately see possible uses for them. One issue you will quickly encounter when trying to use functions is, *"How do I pass data to and from a function?"*.

The simple answer would be to come up with a little rule for your code. For example, you could say, *"Any time I want a function to accept a byte, I can have it read from address \<whatever\>, and I'll be sure to just put my value there before calling the function"*.

And just like that, you invented what is called a *Calling Convention*! Of course, there will need to be more rules around this system, since you might eventually need to write a function that accepts two bytes, or a function that needs to return a byte.

A new issue may arise when you try calling code written by someone else, since they might have come up with a similar system that is not exactly the same as yours.

Once again, the people who come up with these ideas are pretty smart, and they have come up with a common rule called the [*cdecl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl), that is used almost everywhere.

## The C Calling Convention

`cdecl`, or *The C Calling Convention* is defined as follows. (This section is adapted from [this document](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/book/x86-32bit-ccc-chapter.pdf))

This may seem like a lot of work (it is), but it is necessary in order to ensure all functions can inter-operate smoothly.

### The Caller's Rules

 1. Before calling a function, the caller should save the contents of `RAX`, `RCX`, and `RDX` by pushing them onto the stack
 2. To pass parameters to a function, the caller should push them onto the stack in reverse order (last argument pushed first)
 3. Call the function
 4. After the function returns, the caller must remove the arguments from the stack
 5. The return value of the function can be found in `RAX`
 6. The caller can then restore the contents of `RAX`, `RCX`, and `RDX` by popping them from the stack

### The Callee's Rules

 1. The called function should push `push` the `RBP` register onto the stack, then copy `RSP` to `RBP`
    - This effectively creates a new temporary stack for the function, in reality, this new stack just sits at the top of the real stack
    - This is achived by executing:

```x86asm
push %rbp
mov %rsp, %rbp
```

   2. Make space on the stack if needed
   3. The function must save the contents of `RBX`, `RDI`, and `RSI` by pushing them onto the stack
   4. When finished, place the result of the function in `RAX`
   5. Restore the contents of `RBX`, `RDI`, and `RSI` by popping them from the stack
   6. Pop of any variables made in step 2
   7. Pop the saved `RBP` value from the stack back in to `RBP`
   8. Execute a `ret` instruction
